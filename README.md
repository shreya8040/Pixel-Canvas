**Project type:** `Personal`

**Goal:** 
_To create a fun pixel doodling app with a hint of the OG paint tool_

● Made the frontend with React - found the built in color palettes and tinkered quite a bit before choosing the one that is in the final version- one that suited the UI best

● Understood very basic backend by implementeing a suggestion box through MVC, the backend being MongoDB Cluster

● Understood the logic behind exporting as png and svg

>  Tech is a field that's constantly evolving. And that's what makes it so fascinating to me and people all around the world who are into tech.
Slick apps and neat websites are always being churned out and that's mostly a good thing- specially in the creative genre- since they enable artists and creators to do more better and explore more ways of creative expression✨


>  But once in a while it's kinda refreshing to turn back and look at some of the old tech - the ones that helped us get started- a.k.a the OG tech stuff.
So what started out as a vague idea for a section that was gonna be part of my portfolio revamp is now, Pixel Canvas!


>  Taking a lil inspiration for the UI from the OG MS-Paint, it has all the basic tools to draw and color in a grid canvas and so Pixel canvas can be used to whip up pixel themed retro looking icons, doodles and mini drawings that are right now trending and as far as I've seen , part of many apps and portfolios on the internet.
